need ideas for `here's a cool thing you can do', eg
  -- BSL's compile-time error for ho uses of functions
      prereq: raising errors during expansion
        --> maybe need foreshadowing for functions that get called during expander phase
  -- computation at compile time: TR's type checker
  -- leading on from that, turnstile lets you define macros that do the type checking
  -- redex's compile three different ways for generation and running and typesetting


also: what things do I need to foreshadow here?
