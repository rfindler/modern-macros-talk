Racket's approach to language-oriented programming facilitates and
simplifies the implementation of programming languages by providing an
extensible and flexible compiler front end. This front end is, in
truth, a sophisticated macro system that traces its roots back to the
mid 1950s. In those days, macros were mere text-based preprocessors,
divorced from the programming language they operated on (a tradition
that continues only slightly changed today in some programming
languages, alas). In the intervening years, macros have matured and
become a full-fledged part of the programming language itself, making
them far more powerful and general.

In order to explain the power and generality that such a macro system
brings, this tail will focus on three central aspects of Racket's
macro system design:
\begin{itemize}

\item \textbf{the data structure for abstract syntax trees} and how it
  manages binding, avoiding accidental clashes;

\item \textbf{the minimal barrier between ``object'' and ``subject''
  languages}, meaning that as soon as a new language is defined it
  is easily used to build\\ the next language;

\item 
\textbf{the way a set of macros are spread across multiple\\ files and
  yet together form a single compiler}, which\\ allows one language to
reuse parts of another one,\\ even when the two languages are not similar.
\end{itemize}

All three of these design aspects are deeply connected \\ to scope, a
theme that permeates the talk. Racket's so-\\
{\MoreSpace{}phisticated handling of scope even goes beyond lan-}\\
{\setstretch{.9}guage definition, enabling reuse for developer tools like}\\ 
like the compilation manager, the debugger, and the IDE.\\
{\MoreSpace{}The talk will draw these connections and show how they}\\
point the way for future work to automatically or nearly auto-\\
{\MoreSpace{}matically provide sophisticated tool support for programmers}\\ 
writing code in Racket-based languages.
