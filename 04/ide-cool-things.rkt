#lang racket

(printf #<<--

need an introduction-- how can we leverage an open compiler and get an open IDE?

IDE cool things:
  
  -- arrows ----> simple: just track binding. Complex: redex
  -- something in the contract system?  ... blame annotations
      --> TR shows you the types
  -- keystrokes; enforce the language of the module!

also: what things do I need to foreshadow here?
